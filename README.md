## General Information
- The application was used for learning SQLite and basic Python
- The goal was to create a console interface and a second file that contained functions used in main file.



## Technologies Used
- Python 3.11.2
- SQLite3



## Features
List the ready features here:
- Login/Registration.
- Each user has their own list.
- Add, Display, Modify, Delete.
- Automatic save



## Setup
It is likely that the application will run on any system that has Windows and at least 10 MB of memory. 
Installation: download the TSP folder.
Open the folder and run the main.exe file.



## Usage
The first step is to select the appropriate option from the list and confirm it by pressing Enter (each operation needs to be confirmed this way).
If you have selected registration, the first step is to enter your username, followed by a password that must have a minimum of 8 characters.
If you have chosen to log in, you should enter your login first and then your password.

Once you have logged in, you can create your first task, set its content and category.
Now you can display, delete, or modify it.

The last option in both menus is to exit/logout.



## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_ .
In the future, as my skills progress, I would like to add a graphical user interface to the project.
